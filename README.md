## **👤 About Me**

I am a **B.Sc Data Science & Analytics student** focused on building **practical, working solutions** using data, automation, and software fundamentals. My experience spans **company-based automation work**, hands-on **machine learning algorithm implementation**, and **web-based projects**, giving me a balanced exposure to both academic and real-world problem solving.

I value clean logic, clear understanding of fundamentals, and disciplined implementation over shortcuts. I am currently preparing for **entry-level roles and internships** where learning, responsibility, and real contribution matter.
